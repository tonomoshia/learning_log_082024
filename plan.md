# Learning Plan for August 2024

What I want to Learn and How I Am Proceeding

## What I Want to Learn

- Python: I have two Raspberry Pi ( a 4 and a 400) and I would like to learn Python so I can do something cool with them.
- JavaScript: Is the next step on the FreeCodeCamp curriculum and I would like to work my way through that.
- Open Source Intelligence (OSINT): Is interesting and tangentially related to my duties at work
- WordPress: I would like to learn more about Full Site Editing with the Block Editor. This is just a hobby. I also enjoy the community around WordPress and our local in-person meetups have started again.
- Buddhism: for personal reasons
- Prompt Engineering: to get better results from ChatGPT and Perplexity

## How I will proceed for this month
- Python: probably not getting into this month
- Daily work in [FreeCodeCamp][1] with the JavaScript Curriculum
- OSINT: Reading [The OSINT Handbook][4] and trying out some things as I go along
- WordPress: meetups and [LearnWordPress][2] videos
- Buddhism: reading [The Buddha In Daily Life: An Introduction to the Buddhism of Nichiren Daishonin][3] before bed every night
- Prompt EngineeringL not committed to doing much on this this month, but I do have several books about this topic
